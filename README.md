# Eye Tracker Science Fair 2017

An eye tracker was developed that utilizes only a webcam. It tracks the user's eyes from afar and through calibration, it maps the location of gaze to 5 locations of a computer screen. A library was written in C++ (RobustHeadTracking -> also contains pupil detection but no calibration). This library is used to create a GUI application for macOS using AppKit (GUIApplication). 

The following open source libraries were utilized:

- OpenCV 3.1 (computer vision): https://github.com/opencv/opencv
- DLib (facial landmark detection): https://github.com/davisking/dlib
- eos (3D Morphable Face Modelling): https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos
- Eigen (Vector and Matrix Calculation): https://github.com/eigenteam/eigen-git-mirror
